# Chatbot
This project aims to use the GPT API to integrate with various major communication platforms. It utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for unstructured data search (using Langchain) and employs function calling for structured data search. Firebase is used as the backend database to store historical chat records. In the event of a chatbot malfunction, a fallback simple chat function allows businesses to continue interacting with users, enhancing overall response quality and user interaction experience.
## Features
- RAG Framework: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation for unstructured data search.
- Function Calling: Conducts structured data queries through function calling.
- Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase as the backend database to store and manage historical chat records.
- Fallback Mechanism: Provides a simple chat function as a backup when the chatbot fails, ensuring continuous user interaction.
